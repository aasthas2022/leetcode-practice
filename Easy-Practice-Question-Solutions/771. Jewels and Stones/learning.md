### JavaScript Learnings

- **Looping Constructs**: The JavaScript code demonstrates the use of nested `for` loops to iterate over arrays. This is a fundamental concept in JavaScript and is commonly used for tasks such as searching, filtering, or transforming data.

### Python Learnings

- **String Membership Testing**: The code uses the `in` operator to test whether a character from the `stones` string exists in the `jewels` string. Understanding how to test for membership in Python sequences like strings and lists is crucial for various tasks, including searching and filtering data.
